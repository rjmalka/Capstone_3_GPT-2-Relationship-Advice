<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend: why do i feel so bad? what can i do in terms of making amends or even just being honest?  [RESPONSE]i have a friend who is extremely manipulative. i have a strong feeling that you are in a much worse situation than she is. this friend is also very good at making friends with people. i don’t know how she would react if you went to the other friend and asked them to help you with this situation. it’s not fair to the other person to be told “hey: i’m sorry you’re having a tough time: but i would like to help you with this situation.” it’s unfair to have to be told “hey: i’ve got to help you with this situation: even though it’s not fair”. i would honestly ask the other friend what he would recommend to you.
if it was me: i would do
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend.  [RESPONSE]she's being manipulative and it's not fair to the relationship. you're right. she needs to be more transparent about what happened and how she felt about it.

i'm not saying she's lying: just saying that a relationship should be more open. 

if she's not willing to talk to you: i would be finding someone to move in with. 

it's not your job to fix her. 

you need to make it about you. 

she's not an employee. you're the one who is trying to fix it. 

it's your relationship.

you could try to give her a chance to explain herself as a friend. ask her if she needs to talk about it. if she's not willing to talk to you: you should cut her loose.

i don't know how much she's used to the relationship - i don't know if she's
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend’s best friend.  [RESPONSE]thanks for the advice!

i’m going to check my gf’s messages. she mentioned her friend and i’m trying to talk to her. i don’t know if i can talk to her.
i’m trying to see if i can talk to her about it and try again. thank you
i’ve never spoken to her about it. i’d just like to see if we can get to it. i’m not sure how she’s acting in the way i’m assuming she is.
you should have talked to her about it before you decided to contact her about it. you have to try to talk to her first and then if you want to talk. the fact that you chose to not speak to her is probably a sign of how you feel about her.
i’m sorry that this happened
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend  [RESPONSE]it sounds like you two have moved on. if you really want to try to get him back: you have to move on. she needs to understand that you are not going to be able to fix his behavior. you deserve to be treated as less as a friend and more as an equal. i think she needs to understand that you two have moved on and need to move on from each other. i think you need to try to get her back from her friend. i think she will understand that it is not your fault that he cheated and it is her fault that he did. if at all you are able to go back to your old friendship and then have a talk with her. i would suggest you talk to her about this and if she says no: then you can leave it at that. if she is not interested in rekindling and has a different idea: then you can reach out to her to find out if she is interested in seeing you
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]you should never have to deal with this. i am so sorry you had to go through that. i was with my best friend for 2 years. they were in my life for a long time: and i was very happy with them. i would tell you now if you are going to continue to be with her. there is nothing you can do about it but you should not be concerned with what she does or does not tell you about her sexual past. that has nothing to do with you. that is a personal decision that you have to share with her.
don't do it but if she asks you to be her friend: that might be a good thing.

if you want to be her best friend: then that's a good thing. i'd say if she asks you to be her friend: you have to tell her.

if you are with her: that's great but it's also important to tell her. if
?  [RESPONSE]you are not in the wrong.  i think the only person that should be in charge of this is your girlfriend.

if you want to keep her safe: i would cut her out of your life completely.

i hope you both find some way to deal with this.
do you guys trust her to tell you about the cheating?
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend.  [RESPONSE]it's ok if you think it's ok: but if you're not ok then do it. my friend just said that he couldn't deal with it and didn't want to talk about it anymore. sorry: but i can't have that conversation with him anymore.

i think that’s a good thing. it’s a shame that she’s not willing to talk about it
just let her know you werent in a relationship with her for any reason. you can’t force her to talk or anything like that. 

i know it’s not the best response: but if i were in your shoes: i’d just ask her to stop talking to him. i’m not sure how you can force it but if she’s willing to talk then i’d just let her know that you think it’s not working out anymore for you.

<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]it’s a big deal. 

if you feel strongly to talk to an attorney: there’s some good resources on the web that help you navigate this.

[https://www.courts.com/lifestyle/legal/legal-advice/legal-advice-resources/](https://www.courts.com/lifestyle/legal/legal-advice/legal-advice-resources/)

i don’t know if this is on the website but if it is: i’m trying to find a lawyer and get a copy of the law.
this is a really common situation with people with mental health issues: especially if it is the first time you've experienced it. i’m not advocating for you to seek help: but it’s good to know.

my partner also has a mental health issue with depression that could have a
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend and i can’t get over it  [RESPONSE]it's not fair for you to be doing shit like that.
i had the same problem with my husband when we dated. i didn't want to see him and just had my life to be happy. he went through with it: but i felt like i had to have a fight about it. he called me out on it and i told him i didn't want to see him anymore. i was going to get over it and move on. he said he didn't want to be in my life anymore and i told him that as soon as i can.
i don’t think it’s fair for you to be doing that. you need to have a talk with your girlfriend. if she’s really willing to go through with the break up then great. if she doesn’t then she needs a second opinion.
i know that's an immature thing to do:
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]it’s ok to be angry about it: but you need to take yourself out of it. i’m not saying you need to dump her: but you need to be able to be able to talk to her and let her know how you feel.

she could be upset because you didn’t tell her about your girlfriend: and it’s ok to be angry about it. you can’t take her feelings out on her.

if she is upset about it: then you need to discuss with her how you feel. and if she is upset about it: then you need to talk about how you feel with her.

the more you’re together: the easier it will be to have a real conversation: and if it’s not worked out then you need to end things. it’s not like you’re going to get rid of your feelings: but
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]you’re a piece of work.  you are not worth our time.  if you want to stay with him: you’re going to have to leave.  but if you want to leave: you have to let him know.  he’s going to try to get you to leave: and that’s what’s going to be the end of the relationship.  he’s not going to be able to control your feelings and you are going to have to accept it.  if you really want to stay with him: i would break up with him.  if you’re not willing to break up with him: then you shouldn’t stay with him.  i know it’s hard to break up with someone: but it’s better if you do it in the future.  but if you do try to break up with him: you have to give
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend.  [RESPONSE]yeah i’m sorry. it’s hard to put that in your mouth and not have it come to your real life. i don’t want to give him any more chances by telling him about the relationship: but it’s really sad to think about his wife. it’s so sad he won’t feel better.

i guess i’ll just let him deal with it on his own.
why would you need to ask for help? 

your girlfriend is already thinking about cheating.
i agree. i would have asked for help: and i would really appreciate it. and i would have asked her to leave me alone: too: if she knew i was ready to help. i’m sorry if this hurts her. i know she is a good person and she has respect for you.
i understand. i can’t ask for help because i don
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend. please help.  [RESPONSE]i have told her i think i do not want to be in a relationship with her. i have no interest in dating her. it is not my place to judge. i feel like i am always being watched by her. i think i am not getting any answers from her.
i can’t imagine how you feel. 

how long ago was the day she cheats on you?
it’s not about the friendship: it’s about the relationship.  you have to decide if you want to be in a relationship with her and be a part of her life or not.  it’s not fair to her to keep this relationship going.  i can’t imagine how you feel. 

i’m sorry you feel this way. 
i think it’s up to you. 

you can’t force her to cheat.
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend again ?  [RESPONSE]you need to talk to your gf about the relationship and see what she says to you. if she doesn't like it: she can leave the relationship. if she does: then you need to tell her.

if you don't: then i think she needs to leave. you don't have to break up with her.
i can see that you are upset. i would not tell her.
yeah: i think it’d be best if you did. not my place to tell her.
i think you should tell her. i would just say “hey: we need to talk a little more about this. i don’t want to lose you. we should talk more about this. i want to make sure you don’t feel like i’m trying to control you.”.
don’t tell her about her cheating: that would be a huge risk. if
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend: i am in a relationship with her.  [RESPONSE]i have been waiting since this morning to hear from you. i hope this is the last time i contact you.
i don't see that as a problem. he should be able to go out of his way in a relationship to get back together with you. it's not your fault that he's not ready to date you and you should stay at home with him. it's not your fault that he doesn't want to date you.
your girlfriend cheated on you with your friend and you didn't have any proof of her cheating. i think this behavior is a huge deal breaker.  you can't trust her because it's clear she's not ready for a relationship and you should dump her.

you can't trust her because she hasn't shown you how much she's been doing to hide her cheating. if she's willing to cheat on you in the first place: she should be able to

<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]i don't think it will go anywhere. if you are trying to get a better deal and you don't want to tell her she can go to therapy: but you are not sure if it will help you or if it will backfire for her. i don't think the person that cheated on you is going to cheat on you and he will probably do it again.

i don't think it's fair to her to expect her to not be a good friend.
it's ok to say you don't want to tell her. that's one thing you can't do.

it's also ok to say you don't care about her and instead want to see what happens. but what if you don't? it's not the same thing.
if you want to tell him: you can tell him. 

if you don't: you can't keep her around.
i think you need to ask her what
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend and i can’t believe my gf kept it.  [RESPONSE]don't worry about it. she obviously didn't mean it and it is not your fault. you can get over it: but you can't fix it.  it's only going to hurt your relationship with your gf.
she cheated with you. you don’t get to tell her to apologize for it. don’t allow her to play victim with you. she doesn’t deserve to be treated like that. 

it’s absolutely not on you. it’s on you to make them understand what you are feeling: that they can’t blame you for that.
the best thing you can do is focus on yourself and how you can help her. you said your gf is a cheater: however: does she show remorse?
as a person who has been cheated over and over: you definitely should not be

*i am a bot: and this action was performed automatically. please
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]this is not how it's going to go.
it isn't.  the best friend is being completely honest with you.  you won't find his friends in the chat room.  they will be in the group chat.  they are not there for you.  they are there for you.  then there will be a meeting: and you will be able to have a conversation with them.  there will be a meeting with the other person: and their friends.  then after that: there will be a meeting with the person you are talking to.  then there will be a meeting with the person you are talking to.  then there will be a meeting with the person you are talking to.  then there will be a meeting with the person you are talking to.  then there will be a meeting with the person you are talking to.  then there will be a meeting with the person you are talking to.  then
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]i’m sorry: but this is an extremely common. 

it’s really bad to jump to conclusions like that. 

i think you need to ask her what’s going on here. 

she could be feeling as if she’s being abused. 

you need to tell her. 

if she has no one to talk to: she might be scared herself. 

i’ve been in a relationship where i have gotten upset because of my husband not telling me the truth. he felt that i would be unable to handle it. i wasn’t sure if i could trust him. i thought that if i didn’t tell him i wouldn’t be able to trust him. i felt that if i told him i wouldn’t be able to trust him i would be at the end of the relationship.

<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]as many of the comments here have already said: it's not a good idea to put yourself in a relationship with someone who cheated on you.  i can't speak for your friend: but while i don't believe it's a good idea: i can say that she's a good friend who's going to do what's right by her and the relationship.  i also think it's a good idea to tell her that if she ever feels the need to cheat on you again: she needs to tell you and your girlfriend.  it's not her fault that she cheated: but it's your girlfriend's.  that doesn't mean you have to tell her: but it does mean that if she ever does cheat: she's going to tell her and your girlfriend.  she will do what's right for her: even if it's a girl friend that's not a good friend.
this is the best advice i can give.  please
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]i’m sorry you had to go through this. i wouldn’t want to be with someone that i had to deal with that would do this. don’t let him manipulate you: this could change your relationship. 

i hope you find a way to move on: but if not: i’d suggest you talk to someone you trust about it. 

i’ve been in the same situation: i went to the hospital with a friend and my gf: she was upset because of a surgery and her gf said she wanted to go too. i just told her i couldn’t let her go and that i’d be there if she asked me. she was upset because she felt like i didn’t want her to leave. i told her i was going to leave and that she should have asked me first. i didn’t expect to be in her
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend?  [RESPONSE]you should've asked them about it earlier: because if she had the nerve to talk to you about it sooner: you could've been there for her to support and help her cope with it: instead of making it worse for her. 

i would also say that you shouldn't pressure her to apologize for the cheating (which is the way she has behaved so far) and that you should focus on how much you can help her and how much you can help her with coping with it. 

you can't force her to apologize: but you can help her cope with it and help her get over it. 

i would also say that you should be able to communicate openly about your feelings: not as the one who is trying to ""fix"" things with her: but as the one who has been trying to help her for a long time. 

you can give her the option of telling you how you feel:
<|startoftext|>[WP] help my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend  [RESPONSE]i’d call the police and they can help you handle your situation and help you find out what’s going to happen.
you have to go to the police: and they can help you if you need it.

if not: then you have a lot of work to do on your own.

i’ve tried to talk to her about it: but she doesn’t seem to trust me. i have tried for months to talk to her: but she doesn’t want to talk and i tell her i have a plan to leave.

i am going to the police: i’m afraid i’m going to get her arrested for cheating. i need to figure out what i can do to protect her from being arrested.

she needs to be arrested.

your gf needs to be arrested.
i’m so sorry to hear that happened to you
