<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]there is no right or wrong answer here. if you feel like you have a chance to adopt her: i think you should. i know that you probably have so much to look forward to in life that it is hard to put in the time to do it right now: but don't worry: you can be a good parent and not overreact to this. i know that you are so young: but you will be very much in the heart of your grandmother's life and have a chance to grow your family in that time.
thank you for your input: i really appreciate it. i really don't want to make her feel bad or upset about this: but i do want to give her a chance to make up her mind and see if there is any chance to adopt her. thank you again.
i think it’s absolutely possible that her grandparents will want to keep her as a pet. 

they probably probably won’
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i get that: but i also feel it's unfair to both of you and your grandma to be forced to adopt an animal that may not have been born: and it's unfair to your grandma to be forced to adopt an animal that may not have been bred to be a pet. 

i have a feeling your grandmother has a very unhealthy view of pets and he's also a dog lover who loves dogs. that aside: you're being groomed as an adult and your grandmother is a teenager and therefore is not thinking clearly. 

he's also a very old dog who has been neglected for years: so it's not really a shock that he's a little bit older. he could be a nice dog: but i'm also a dog lover and i know that's not a good idea to put a dog on a leash and put it on a leash. i've done it to many dogs: and it's not the best idea.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]it's not the fault of the child that they're adopted.  the fault is the child that they're the parent.  the child is the parent.  

i'm sorry to say this: but they're not your grandchildren at all.  they're your grandmothers.  they are a part of you.  you have to get behind the kid.  it sounds like you're in the minority: but it's important for you to be a part of the child's life.  you don't want to have to deal with it: but you do want to have to give it up.  if you can do that then that's good enough for you.

i don't care if it's a friend or family member: you gotta do it because it's your right.  and since i'm a grandma: i'd like to see if you can get a call from their grandmother to see if they'll adopt.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]thank you! i’m so sorry this happened to you.  

she has a lot of support but i’m just so confused.  
thanks again for your input!
i’m sorry to be so blunt.  i’m too old to be worried about this.  i’d just let it happen and move on.  my mother just can’t understand me and i can’t understand her.  but the best thing i can do is just talk it out with her.  that’s all i can do.  i know i can’t change her: but i can’t change her opinion.  i don’t want to be with a mother who doesn’t support me.  i want her to stay and support me.  it’s not fair to me.  i have a great grandma and i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you should have it done in the first place. she is my grandmother.

you can't make her do this: but you can help make her feel the same way. if you’re willing to do it: i can recommend the adoption site: www.adoptioncenter.org.

you can also talk to a lawyer to help you decide what to do.

you can also make a request to a surrogate. i know it sounds weird but you can request a surrogate.

you can also have her adopt you.

she will need to have you consider a surrogate.

you can not be a dad. you can not be a mother.

your mom doesn't have to do anything at all. you can be a dad.

it's not your job to make her feel bad. it is her job to show her that she has an obligation to make sure you're a dad.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i understand that you're upset with the adoption. i can understand that. i think that's very important to talk about. i also understand that your family is a very small family and that's why you're worried. 

i think it's okay for you to have a conversation with your grandmother about this. just be honest with her. tell her that you don't want her to be the one to adopt her. i would also let her know that you are sad that her daughter isn't getting the opportunity or the chance to adopt.
that’s right. that’s how it’s been for a long time. i’ve even had a few conversations about this but it hasn’t changed much in the past 10 years.
i agree. i’m very sorry for the loss of my grandparents.
it’s sad that you’re going through this. i can’
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you can say yes. i don't want to. i can't do that.
i am not sure if it's the same person.
i'm not sure if it's the same person. 

it's not a big loss.
it's a small loss.
i'm not sure if it's the same person.
that's not the best advice. 

in my country i'm in: i was adopted as my firstborn by a woman who was very close to my mother. she was very happy for me the entire time. 

you could adopt it: i don't know if it's the same person. 

i'm not sure what you're looking for from me.
i know i'm not a good person to adopt. but i love my grandmother. 

i'm not sure if it's the same person.
you can't do anything to her.  
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don’t want to ruin my relationship with my grandmother. i don’t want to hurt her or her relationship. i don’t want to lose my relationship with my grandmother. i don’t want to ruin my relationship with my grandmother. i don’t want to hurt my grandmother’s relationship with her grandchildren. i don’t want to ruin my relationship with my grandmother. i don’t want to do anything to upset my grandmother. i just want to give my grandmother up for adoption. can i do that? how do i go about doing that?  [RESPONSE]i’m sorry you have to deal with this. i’m sorry you are going through it. 

i’m going to say this loud and clear: you don’t need to feel guilty about this. you need to find out what you can do to help your grandmother. 

if
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]this is not a good idea. 

1. your grandmother needs to be a member of a family that wants your grandmother to be a member of a family that wants to adopt her. 
2. your grandmother is doing nothing wrong by wanting to adopt your grandmother. 
3. your grandmother needs to be able to understand that adoption is not something that you can "just"" do. 
4. you need to understand that if you want to adopt your grandmother: then you need to have the conversation about the adoption. 
5. if you decide to adopt your grandmother: then you need to have a conversation about the adoption. 
6. if you decide to adopt your grandmother: then you need to have a conversation about the adoption. 
7. if you decide to adopt your grandmother then you need to have a conversation about the adoption. 
8. you need to have a conversation about the adoption. 

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. what should i do?  [RESPONSE]have fun!
that’s why i wrote “cancelling the adoption”.
yes it’s a great idea: i’m just worried of how i’ll feel going through this and i’ll probably just end up being the one to adopt. i’m in a relationship with my grandmother who is in her 80s. she is in her 90s and i’m in my 20s. i’m not sure how i’m going to feel after that. i’m not sure if i’m going to be able to just cancel the adoption with her or if i’ll lose her.
i’ve done it before: she was an adopted kid. i have a small family that adopted her: the rest is up to you: but if you’re not planning to adopt then i’
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]the best thing to do is to tell her that you wish to adopt her and ask her if she would like to come visit.  if she agrees: then i think you should make an adoption plan and do it.  if the meeting doesn't go well: i think you should leave it at that.

i would recommend the adoption process as well: if at all.  if you don't want to leave and your grandmother doesn't want to adopt: then that's fine.  if she agrees: then you should make an adoption plan and do it.  if the meeting doesn't go well: i think you should leave it at that.
my grandparents adopted my mother and they are still together.  they have a good relationship.
i am going to have to say before that i don’t think it’s worth arguing about adoption.  the idea is to be careful and not raise the possibility of it being a

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. how do i go about it?  [RESPONSE]just ignore her. she is being very controlling and rude.

i would have you talk to a lawyer about the adoption and see what you can do to protect yourself.

i would not go through with it: as it would be a big step for her to take.

you can also try to find someone who has the best interest for her.

it is not fair for her to force you to give up your own children. she has made it very clear that she does not want you to take that chance: and that is something you need to understand. i am sorry you are going through this. i would hope you can help your grandmother and your children so that they can be free from the stress.

you can say to your mom: ""my mom wants to adopt my kids. i don't want to adopt her: what will you do?"" and she will say ok.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]it’s a different story for everyone: but if you have a good relationship with your grandmother: you can’t help where you go with it. i would recommend a lawyer. 

you can make an arrangement with a lawyer to get a lawyer to write a letter to your grandmother letting her decide whether to adopt your mother. i would have that written for her so she could sign it. if she chooses to adopt: you need to contact an adoption attorney to get them involved.

this will be a long story. i hope that you can leave the situation here and focus on the adoption process. if you don’t have an attorney: i recommend that you call the adoption attorney and ask them to help you with your adoption.
i'm glad you are willing to take the decision and if not then i would consider it unfair to ask for a judge to hear your case. i was in the same situation and the judge
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you are not an aunt. you should not be a grandparent. 

i would let her take the kids with her and put her foot down. 

let her know you don't want this. 

you have said no to adoption so she can take them with her and give her a better chance. 

she will be much happier living with you now. you can also take the kids with you. 

your grandmother is not the only person in your life. you are also in the past. 

you can't make her change her mind. you can only help her. and yes: you have to be there for her. 

i hope you are able to find a happy family and get on with your life. if you are not able: then you can give her some space until she is ready. 

i would also urge you to ask your grandmother if she wants to
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i would never give your grandmother up for adoption. if it makes you happy and makes you feel a bit happier i would recommend you to talk to her and tell her that you want to adopt her because it makes her feel more loved and that you want her to be with you in the long run. 

i think that you should give her a letter from your grandmother and then tell her about the adoption and tell her to make a decision. if she refuses to adopt you can move on with your life and if she refuses you have to adopt her. 

if she does adopt you should tell her that you want her to adopt you. i would tell her to take a picture of the letter with the photo of the child and then show it to her so that she can adopt it. 

i would also suggest telling her that you want her to adopt you and that you want her to stay with you.

i think that it
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don't want to be alone with her or her family. how does that go?  [RESPONSE]i think you might have to ask her about this. ask her if she's happy to have you be with her family. if she is: then great! if not: then you should have a conversation with her about how you feel and what you want to do.
i don't think she has to do anything. i know they are going through a very difficult time. i just want to be there for her. if she doesn't want to adopt: she can still have the kids and then decide what to do. i don't think that would be fair to her.
[deleted]
i agree with you there. i am just concerned with the fact that she wouldn't tell me.
i was in the same situation as you. i have a good friend who is very open and i can see where her family is at.

i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]this is a good idea. i have no idea where you can go or how to proceed.
it’s a bad idea if you’re trying to raise your dead loved one.
you can’t. she’s not going to want you to: and it’s not fair for her to do that.

you’re basically saying that you can’t get her to agree to adopt your dead grandmother. it’s absolutely not fair.

you’re completely wrong.
if you think you can get her to agree to adopt your dead grandma: then that’s a good start: but if you can’t: then that’s the end of your relationship.
you’re probably right: i’m a guy who's got a gf who has a gf that has a gf. i just don’t
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i would be happy to. i’ve had a friend that had to go through a similar situation. when i told her i’d like to adopt her i was scared and upset: but she said she’d love me and have a baby with me. i think there is a lot of things with a child that can be overcome and i’d really like to try. i don’t know if i could trust my grandmother as well as i do my daughter. she is a great grandmother but i don’t see a future with her. i think i’ll just have to wait until i get a divorce.
that’s a good start. i’m not sure if that’s the mother or the father i’d like to adopt.
i didn't actually agree with that. i was just trying to say that it can be hard to adopt a child.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i’m so sorry you were in this situation.

i’m a woman who was in the same situation. my family accepted my mother’s decision and gave me to my family. i had been in my hometown for 3 years and i didn’t have the money to adopt. i had a very strict family that i was not accepted by. i was a teen and i knew i was going to not be accepted by my family. so i chose my family and chose to adopt. i felt so bad not being accepted by my family. i was so sad i could not hug my grandmother. i had tears in me. i was so afraid. i cried and cried. i could not let my family know. i couldn’t give my grandmother a hug or a kiss. i was so mad that i didn’t hug her. i was so mad and so angry. i cried for hours. i was
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i understand that you don’t want to lose your grandmother: but you can't force her to do something that has nothing to do with you. i wouldn’t suggest that you ask her to make the decision on you. if she does: you can’t force her to make it for you. 

you don’t have to wait for her to decide. i know that for many people: this is the thing that is holding them back from adopting their own children. but for your grandmother: i think you should give it a shot. not because you love her: but because it makes you feel a little better. 

if you have any questions about the adoption process: please feel free to [send me a pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/relationship_adoption) and i will do my best to help.<|endoftext|
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i would not want to have any children from my grandmother at all.
you have to accept whatever it is that you want from your grandmother. you can't do anything to change her choice. 

if you do it: you are going to have to live with her.

it's okay to go to a friend or family member to ask them for permission to adopt. at that point you can decide if you want to keep the child or not.

if you have a friend or family member that you can contact: you can ask them to adopt you and ask them to adopt your grandmother.

if you have the option to keep your grandmother: you can ask them to adopt you.

just make sure that you have someone to talk to. 

if you want to adopt your grandmother: you may be able to adopt her if you ask them to adopt you.

if you want to adopt your grandmother:
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]if you don't want her in your life: don't. 

if you do: give her the opportunity to get a full and fair chance at adoption.

if it's not fair to your family: why would you want to take her?

you can’t just say you won’t take them: and then refuse to adopt her.  you have to come to terms with her in order to stay in the world and not be forced to keep her around.

i guess she's a person with her own life.
i’m with you. i was also with my husband for a year and a half. i would never divorce my husband for this. he didn’t care for me and i didn’t want to raise him as a person. 

i’m so sorry you had to go through this. it is one thing to not be able to stand
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you don't have to do anything.  you will be in the room with her for the adoption ceremony.  if you want to adopt her: you will have to do that.  there is no way you can force her to marry you.  you do not have her blood.  you only have her voice.  you do not have her body.  you do not have her personality.  if you will adopt: then you have to be there for her to be adopted.  you have to love her.  if you do not: then you are going to lose her.  you do not have to do anything.  you do not have to do anything.    

what i understand from my own experience is that the adoption process is painful and emotionally draining.  i am going to do what i can to make her as happy as possible.  when i tell her: i make it known that i want to
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i agree 100%.   

you would need to go through the adoption process.  

i would ask about it with a professional.  

there is a website that can help you: adoption.org. there is also a group that has info on adoption that will help you.  

you are also entitled to her in the future.   

i understand having a child with your grandmother: but i don't think i've ever met a person who would agree to that.  

i think it would be best if you were to hold on to her until her death.  

i know this might sound extreme: but i would love to see her and her children in person. i know it sounds strange: but what is the best way to have a long conversation about your wife?

you are absolutely entitled to make a decision you have to live with: and
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i know i'm not ready but i don't want to ruin my grandmother's life. what do i do?  [RESPONSE]you should definitely try to get her a foster family or get her to go to a friend's house.

i think it’s important to understand that you don’t have to get her pregnant. i’ve known a few people who’ve been through this. it wasn’t as bad but in the end their children were dead. it’s very difficult to have a baby and it took a long time.

the other problem is you have to get a restraining order. she may be able to keep you from getting her pregnant.

i’m not sure if you can get her to take you back but i think you’re in a position that’s a little more difficult. if she’s willing to get a restraining order: i’
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i have a lot of respect for you and i don’t feel like i’m going to be able to do it.  thank you for your opinion!
thank you so much. i’ll keep it confidential.
i think i’m going to have to. i’m also going to try and get her on the birth certificate. i’ll wait until her parents are back and then get her a birth certificate.
i’m so sorry you’re going through this! i’m so sorry you’re in a situation like this. i’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

thank you for your input!
i’ve been in a situation like this before and it was so painful. i had to go to the hospital to give birth: i went to the post office and got her a birth certificate: i got
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don't know what to do.  [RESPONSE]i know: thanks for the advice!  i actually think that i wouldn't have to ask for my grandmother to be adopted because i don't know what could be done about it.  i mean: i am very concerned about my grandmother being able to look at her grandchildren and not be disturbed by them.  i'm not sure if i can ask for her to come over to my house and we can have a talk about the adoption or if i can bring it up in a friendly manner.
you need to be able to give an informed answer.  if she is willing to consider the adoption please tell her.  she is in no position to say if that is a good idea and if not she should consider it.  she may be able to understand that you are concerned but it really does not seem to be a good idea to ask for her to be a part of that adoption.  then move forward
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]just talk to her. be open and honest with her. tell her that you want to give her up for adoption. if she says no: then you'll be happy to keep her. if she says yes: then you'll stay with her. if she rejects you: then you'll stay with her.

i'm not sure if this is in the u.s.: but there is a very similar procedure where you want to give your mother up for adoption. the procedure is a bit different because it's not as straightforward as giving your grandmother up. it's basically the same but it's less painful.
if she rejects you: then you're already in the clear.

but: if she does choose you: then i think you should ask her what she would like you to do. i'd probably give you the option to keep your grandma in your life. i'm assuming you can get your mom to accept you as a foster parent
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i was in an orphanage: where i'd be taken to a different room and given the same opportunity. it was sad: but i loved the idea of a surrogate. i also wanted to keep my grandmother as a friend. i've been in many foster homes: and i know that children who have not been adopted can end up being abandoned. it's more difficult for them to find their own homes: which makes it even more difficult for them to find a family. i also don't want to be a stranger in another's home. i just feel it's not fair to be discriminated against. thank you for your input.
i have a strong feeling you'll be a great grandmother.

thank you for your comment.

i think you need to take a deep breath: and realize that your grandmother is not a ghost: she's a person who is now a part of your life. it's not going to be easy for you to
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. how should i proceed?  [RESPONSE]you have to be honest with her. if she is willing: then it is not worth the effort. 

i'm so sorry you are dealing with the trauma of this situation. it will only get worse. 

i’m so sorry you are going through this.

i’m so sorry you are going through this.
i was in my 20's and had a miscarriage shortly after my dad got my mom. i was devastated. i got so many grief counselors and i’m now an independent counselor. i’m not a family therapist.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]is she willing to adopt you?

i was raised to not think about adoption unless it was the most important decision of my life. i don't want to be around my grandmother who i'm told has issues with adoption. but i think it's great for her to be adopted.

i just feel that her grandmother is in the wrong here. i'm not going to say she has some hidden agenda here. 

but i think it would be a good idea for her to adopt you.
i’m so sorry to say this but you are both wrong. i’m going to have to go with you. 

you’re the one who has to work for adoption. it’s not your fault.
my grandma and i have been together for over 40 years. my grandpa has been fighting for adoption for the past 15. my grandma is not happy at all. but i have the
  [RESPONSE]it might help if you talk to her for a while. she might want to know your feelings too. 

if she doesn’t: i’d put it in writing: and see if she can make it happen.

she never used to be happy. it’s hard to explain. it’s a difficult time in the world. 

the only thing that i can think is that she may have changed in the past few years: and will not be happy for you if she doesn’t: but that’s ok with me.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. am i being too selfish?  [RESPONSE]you have to be more understanding of the situation.  it’s very unfair to the child.  you are not a god or any other god.  and if you decide to keep her: it will be a waste of time and money.  you will have to wait for your mom to find a suitable family member.  if you ever need to speak to her: you can text her and ask her to contact you.  in this state: there is an adoption center in your area (you can call them or visit their website).  you can also contact your state.  i’d imagine it would take some time to get to know a new person.  that person may be your grandma.  she might not want to have her daughter.  that person may be a relative or friend.  you can tell her that you feel bad for the situation but that you will help in any way you
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don’t know if i am going to be able to raise her or not.  [RESPONSE]i would start by telling her that you are considering adoption in a very specific way. what you're doing is making it clear that she is important to you. it's possible that she might not be interested in adoption: but you have to be very clear in what you're asking for.

i would also say this: you have to be very clear with her that you don't want to get her pregnant. if she doesn't want to get you pregnant: that means that you can't put her in the mix. i know that's hard for a lot of people: but it's not fair for her to be there to deal with the pregnancy and the baby.

if the decision doesn't change much: i would end things. i want to be with an older woman who will appreciate me and the family and i don't want to be with
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]it means you have to give up your right to be here.   if you can’t give up your right to be here: then you are not gonna help her and she doesn’t deserve to be here.  i have never gotten a new family member to adopt a child: but i’m going to give it a shot.   just know that it’s a possibility. 

my grandma is a good grandma: and i want to adopt her.  my grandma was the only one to give up her right.  i have her as a family member: and i want to adopt her.  i have no idea if it’s possible for me to adopt her or if it won’t work.  i’m just scared that if i adopt her i’ll lose my right to be here.  i’m worried that if i do that: my grandma
  [RESPONSE]i’d be happy to do it for free. it’s a good way to make the person you want to adopt feel like a family member.
if you can’t do it by yourself: just ask your grandmother to adopt you for free. it’s a good way to make the person you want to adopt feel like a family member.

[i think]  [RESPONSE]you do have the right to give up your right to life for a while. you can ask for a court order to stop at any time. and if she gives the order: then you can have her put her foot down and stop the adoption in the least harmful way possible.
i’m sorry you’re going through this. 

i can’t make you understand better: but i’m sorry you have to go through this.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i feel i have to give her up.  [RESPONSE]i understand. i don't want to. 

why? because she is a woman. 

so: what if it's in the air: what if she decides i don't want to get married? 

i don't want to have to give her up that much later. 

but i don't want to give up something important.

i have to. and i have to do what's best for her. 

i don't want to go through with it. 

so: what do i do? 

i give her a choice. 

i decide to keep her: and give her the baby. 

but i don't want to be the one to get her out.

i don't want to get married. 

and i don't want to have her in my life. 

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]she doesn’t need to decide if you can afford it or not. i’m not denying that at all. but your mother is wrong. i think it would be a good idea to ask her. i’d also be curious if you can get her to agree. if she refuses: then it’s up to you to tell her. if she doesn’t agree: then it’s up to you to end it.
you’re not the only one who needs to decide: but your grandmother is. and if she doesn’t want you to adopt her: she doesn’t need to decide. 
   
you have a right to decide if you want to keep her or not: but that doesn’t mean you can’t have a conversation about what you want to do or who you’ll keep her as a pet. 
 
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i agree and you’re right. i would be very careful with her. i’m sure she’s very proud of me and i know that. i’ve tried to explain my concerns to her but it didn’t go well. she seemed to be really uncomfortable at first and it was very confusing for me too. i’ve tried to explain to her that i feel like she’s not going to be comfortable with the idea of adoption and would prefer to wait and see what happens. she agrees and i just ask if we can work on bringing it up again. i feel like i’m not being allowed to have that conversation. i guess i’m just a dumbass. i know that it’s my grandmother and she wouldn’t want to see me and i know that i can’t do anything about it but i don’t want to be a
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i have no idea how to go about it.  [RESPONSE]a couple things:

1. she is a woman. she needs to make decisions for herself. i don't think you can blame her for not knowing how to handle this. 
2. you need to talk to your family. if they are still supportive but have differing opinions on the adoption: then i think that's okay.
3. you need to talk to your grandparents and explain to them how you feel. they may be reluctant and may not have any experience with adoption - i don't think they can completely help you but you have to be honest.
i think you need to give her a heads up. she's making a decision on her own. you are the one that needs to help her. if you can't help her: then i can't help you. 

you need to be honest with her and help her decide.

i think i can help
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. she is my oldest grandchild and i am upset.  [RESPONSE]i’m sorry you got married in a country that is so racist. i’ve been in a country like that: and i can tell you what you’re going to get from it. its not a place where you can get away with being black. it’s not a place where you can afford to leave. 

you will get the same treatment. the first time we tried to divorce was in a country where i had to take a break for a month. there was no way i was going to get away from that country. i’m in a country that has a history of violent and racist people. 

i’m not saying you won’t get the same treatment. but it’s a tough one. i’m just saying you have to go through this with a bit of wisdom: and there�
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you can help by reaching out to a local adoption agency. this will help get the word out and help in the adoption process.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i could do it and it would be something i’d like to remember for the rest of my life. i’m not going to be in his life at all. i’d just be happy that my grandmother is going to be adopted. i’m proud of her and i love her. i don’t want to be the bad guy. i want to be able to be proud of her and happy for her and that’s how it will feel to have her adopted.
it’s really not your choice at all and it’s not your responsibility at all. 

is that what you want? 

i’m not sure if you’re in a relationship: but if you are in a relationship: i’d recommend you go through with the adoption: and then consider it a “thank you” for helping her through this. you want
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]she's going to have to take care of the children.
so she's being really kind by letting the children be adopted without her having to get involved. i agree with you that it's better to have a child of your own than one of hers.
[deleted]
[deleted]
i dont think it's the best idea to adopt a child for adoption.
[deleted]
i would say to not adopt them. they will always be in this family. in this situation: it's not fair to the family if they adopt them.

i can't comment on this because i don't know the situation of her: but i will say that it's not going to be fair to her. because her husband can't find someone who wants to adopt them. he'll be forced to spend a year with them: or two: with a new family.

as for her: i would say to her to
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you don’t have to do anything. 

you don’t have to tell her mother or anyone else.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i think you're going to have to do it: but i don't know if you can do it with your mother. i know it's tough: but you're going to have to make your own decision. 

if you can't find a way to do it yourself: then i would recommend talking to a family member.

i had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a family member that had a
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you can’t make someone do anything without first having to give them an ultimatum. 

i don’t think you can force a decision unless you are willing to do it. 

i think the easiest way to do that is to have a discussion with her about what happens if she doesn’t accept. 

i’m not saying this is how the rest of the community will react in this situation: but if you don’t have a conversation: then either she will not adopt you or she will keep you as a friend.
i’m sorry: but that’s not the way it works.

you can’t tell her to not adopt you. you can’t tell her to have an adoption. you can’t make her adopt you. she will have to accept it and be a part of your lives. 

i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. my grandmother is a great grandmother and i don’t know if i will ever be able to accept her.  [RESPONSE]i think you're right. it's also possible that she didn't want to adopt you. she may be in a position where it's best to move out and make their lives better or move in with you. 
i would also ask yourself if you really want to put up with this. i've been in a situation like yours: and i didn't want to cut anyone loose. if you can't accept it: then you should just end it.
you are the one that needs to be there for your grandmother: not her. i understand that you are not in a relationship and have not been with your grandmother for this long. 

i think you should end it.
i'll take this one step at a time. if you have any questions: i would ask them in person. if you can't ask in
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. my grandfather has to be a single mom. (1)  [RESPONSE]my grandparents have been there for a long time and they always wanted me to adopt. they are also the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones who have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones who have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the ones that have been the
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i'm so sorry you're going through that. i know it's a lot for your grandmother: but if you don't want to be that person then don't adopt. i'm glad you have my support. you have to be a good person and be there for her when she needs it.
i don’t have much advice because i’ve always felt this way.  i don’t know if it’s because i’m not as involved in the family: but i feel like it’s easier for her to get out of that situation.  i know what your grandmother is doing is not cool: and i know you don’t mind.  i don’t know if it’s a dealbreaker for you: but i’m a little concerned about it.  she’s not going to tell you if she tries to keep the baby: and if she
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. how can i explain this to her?  [RESPONSE]i think it’s a good idea to put a document with a lawyer in your pocket and give them a copy of the divorce decree.
you would be surprised how many people think that’s a good idea. 

it’s not wrong to adopt a young child in order to raise them.

you’re not going to be able to adopt them: so it’s better to keep them.
it's not wrong to adopt a child in order to raise them.

you will be raising them to be a person: and you will have to learn to live with the fact that they will be a part of you for the rest of your life. 

of course: it’s not wrong to adopt a child in order to raise them: but you may not have to deal with that for the rest of your life.
if the
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. but i don't want to give the child up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]well not to say that you should give in to the decision. but if you can afford to: i would suggest to: while you are in a relationship with a relative that you feel comfortable with: you would have the time and the financial resources to try to adopt. 

this is the best option for a grandmother of your generation. but of course she needs to know first.
that's the thing i'm trying to avoid doing this. it's a huge thing for women to have to choose between their family and their child and it's also a huge decision for a woman to have to adopt and it's also a huge cost for the child. i think it's really important to have a conversation with your family and see what they think about it. if they are open to the idea: i believe it will help them understand how much it will hurt the child and if they want
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. my dad is being really hard on me. (21m)  [RESPONSE]i wish i was her daughter. you can't let her mother turn you down. it's the wrong thing to do. i'm not saying you shouldn't be upset with her. but it is not appropriate to take her life. you need to be ready to leave the house or to move: and do what's best for you.
i'd leave her: but i think she's a little too young. 

it's like if you were in the military: your dad would be a great guy to have around. but i wouldn't be able to do anything about him being a coward. 

if you want to: you could go to your grandma and tell her you want to adopt her. she would probably like it. if not: then maybe don't adopt her. i'd have someone there to help with the adoption process.
i would consider this a
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i think it’s the people who are not in love with their gf who aren’t telling them anything that they don’t want to hear.  

the people who are trying to put their hands on their family to get them to agree to the adoption.
i'll take it from you:  if you stay with your mother: it won't be fair to you to be around her every day.  if you have to go to her regularly: it's fair to her to do the same.  her attitude won't change.  i think the issue with her is that she's clearly not interested in you and your feelings for her.  she's a woman who wants a baby.
i don't think that’s fair.  you’re not her only child.  you’re a person that she has to go to for all of your needs.  it’
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don't know what to do about it  [RESPONSE]i think it’s ok to give your family a chance to raise you better: but you have to plan and make sure you’re not gonna be a stranger around her for the rest of your life. 

i can understand your heart but i think it’s better to let her be alone for a while: then decide if you want to adopt her or if you want to stay with her and raise you. and in the end you’ll have to decide if you’d like to stay with her or not.
i’m sorry you’re going through this but what you’ve described is the truth. you can’t let this happen. i’d just be glad you’ve been able to get your head above water and then decide if you want to adopt her or not. you are being very selfish. i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i don't want them to take her back: but i'll give my grandpa the adoption fee: maybe not the money for the adoption or a part of it: but the adoption fee.

i know it's not the money i want but i will give my grandpa the adoption fee.

also: that's a pretty good amount of money for a family of 3. also: i'm not saying it will happen because she's my grandmother: but it's a good idea to do it because i think your grandpa will want to adopt you: and that's a good thing.
i can't give you any more advice than that...
please do not let her go.    

i think you should have an honest conversation with your grandpa.    
i want to give my grandpa the adoption fee: maybe not the money for the adoption or a part of it: but the adoption
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. what should i do?  [RESPONSE]your grandmother is a person you can trust. you can do a lot of stuff to her.   if you are worried about how she will react: you can try to be more present. i am in a relationship that i can't help but do my best to try to be there.
i have to say if you truly care about her: you need to make it clear that you are not going to adopt her. i think you need to go to adoption events: but if not: then i would suggest to contact a local adoption center. 

you don't have to go through all of this alone.  it's great that you and your grandmother are both willing to go through with adoption.  i have a friend that went through this: and they are now in a relationship where she is a stay at home mom and i am the foster dad.  you can also help you foster her a little bit.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i am in the us with no money.  [RESPONSE]i understand the need for money and i have always been there for her: but i have also been responsible for the costs. i have done everything i can to try to help her financially and it has been very difficult. i see where her situation is and i will try to help financially as well. it hurts and i hate to tell her that i will not be there for her financially. i can understand why she is so upset about it. i have made every effort to help her financially and it has been very difficult. i can only speak for myself. i have been in this situation and the only thing that comes to mind is to do what i can to help. she doesn’t have to expect me to help financially. i don’t have any family in the us and have been trying to help her financially for the past 5 years. i’m in no position to ask for an
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don’t know if i can afford to do it or want to wait and see if i can find a donor or if i’ll have to buy her a dog. i can’t have it done. i don’t want her to be adopted or not.  [RESPONSE]if you can’t afford to: you have to either save up the adoption fee or start a new adoption agency and have them look for a new family. they will never forget their dog or their home.
you can't afford to do it.  you're young and can't even have a dog until you're old enough to get a license.  there's a difference between being a baby and an adult.  if you can't deal with the adoption process: you can't make the decision.  you're only giving your grandma a chance at a dog that could be used for a generation.  that's what you want to do.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. what should i do?  [RESPONSE]i think i will do it. i’m not sure if there are any other people in the family that will adopt me in the future. i’m looking forward to the day when my grandmother has a son and the adoption will be finalized.
i know it’s a bit late for a wedding and i’m not sure if it’s because i’m planning something in the future. thank you for your advice.
i can’t date any family members. i only can contact my friends family.
you can’t date my family. i have to tell them first.
if they don’t want you: they’ll have to let you.
if they don’t want you: they’ll have to let you.
you’re not overthinking this one.
i’d try to let them
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i can't: but i would like to keep my grandson from it.  [RESPONSE]that's fair: that's exactly what i thought. but a year ago she was my first choice. i don't know what to do with him and i've been planning on finding a home for years if i can't get her out of my current home.
[deleted]
i'm sorry you have to deal with this.  i don't think it's fair to keep someone who you have no contact with for their own safety.  i think it's probably best to have him adopted out of your community.  i think the adoption will help him with a strong connection to you: but i don't think it will be a good match for you.
i think that is a good idea. 
i'm not sure how to do it in the future.  i also think it will be detrimental to the child and your daughter if you try to get
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i’m sorry to be blunt: but you have to give her a chance. it’s a lot for a young girl to understand the dynamics of the adoption process. i’m so sorry that she won’t have a chance. the next time you see her: make sure you’re there and not just saying “hey: we’re gonna adopt you”. that’s a bit presumptuous: but i wouldn’t give her up. you deserve someone that will love you as a person and your family.
so what's the alternative: that you're trying to find out?

i don't think anything in the post makes sense. i know you need to hear from a professional about the adoption process: but your grandmother is dead. 

the only person who can help her is the state: but unfortunately it's not possible to do anything more than that
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]thanks for the advice! 

i’m sorry for your loss: i hope you’re able to find some help or something
i don’t think you have to ask: but i would recommend contacting the adoption agency.
this has happened to so many people.
thank you so much: your message made me so happy! i have my dad who is the only one in the world to accept me for a child at no cost. he’s really not that into the adoption and i am the only one who will raise it. thank you for sharing your heart with me! i hope this helps.
i’m so sorry you have to go through this. i hope you can find some strength and find some answers to this.
i’m so sorry that you’re going through this. you’ve been through so much: and i’m so sorry you’
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. can you help me?  [RESPONSE]no: it's not her fault.

you are not entitled to the person she will eventually adopt.  you don't get to say that.  if you want her to adopt you: then you have to agree to it.

i was with my dad for a while but didn't go through with it.  i don't think anything will change unless he changes his mind.  i'm glad it's happening now and i can't wait anymore.

i guess it's not about her or anything else.  she was there: as i said: and if that's the reason he wants to keep her: then i'll have to work on getting over it.

we'll see.
it’s not her fault.   she was there for a long time.  she is not entitled to the person she will adopt.   the adoption process is the same as the adoption
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you are not in the wrong for wanting to adopt her: you are just not in the right place to adopt her.

you don't have to think about how she's going to feel.  if you do: then you need to be kind

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don’t want to do it for her.  [RESPONSE]i don't think your parents or grandparents would be very happy to see your father. i wouldn't be too sure about your mother. i think it's a good idea to be upfront with your family.
you could always tell your parents that you want to adopt them and then tell them you want to adopt your grandmother out of respect for them. your grandparents will be supportive if you tell them. there's not really any harm in telling them. they would have a say in it.
i don’t know about the grandparents. i’m sorry it’s so difficult for you to go through with it. they were my parents and i loved them dearly all the way to the day. 

that being said: i’m going to give it a shot. i have a sister who is in a similar situation: and she is so sorry. 

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you can only do so much. it is very important to not only get a foster family: but also to get it for you. i have to imagine that it will not be easy to find a family member you like. i would strongly recommend to find a family member that will accept your need for the adoption to happen and that you can visit with.
it takes a lot of trust to adopt someone: and a lot of the stress on the part of the adoptive family.

first of all: the adoption process is very stressful. you will have to deal with a lot of emotions and stress on your part. 

you will also have to deal with a lot of emotions and stress on your part. you need to be flexible with how you handle all of these emotions. 

you need to be flexible with how you handle each of these emotions. 

you will have to deal with a lot of stress on your part.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. she wants me to have the baby and i am against it because i am against the idea of adoption. i am a woman and i would be happy with the baby i have at least.  [RESPONSE]i think that if you and your grandmother agree that you have to have an abortion: then you will need to have an abortion. 

i also don’t know if you have to have a second pregnancy. i’m not sure if your grandmother’s family has to be involved.
i think you should go to an abortion clinic in your area. they will provide you with counseling. the state will provide you with a pregnancy test and you can take the test and receive an abortion pill.

you would be the first to know if you get an abortion or not. it’s very important that you are very careful and if the pregnancy is a result of a miscarriage: i’d be concerned because this could result in
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. what should i do.  [RESPONSE]i mean: it's pretty obvious from the way she's acting that she's going to be very upset about it. i'd consider that a dealbreaker. if you want to keep your grandson: i think you can do it. 

if she wants him back: i think he could be rehomed. i think the adoption would be a dealbreaker for her.

however: if you're having problems with the adoption: i think you need to talk to your child's mother. i'd recommend you have a talk with her first. 

if you have any questions about the adoption: please feel free to [send me a pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/relationship_adoption)
you can also support him financially if he has money. it would not be fair to his daughter to be forced to take in another child if
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]thank you for your response. i think it’s important to be honest with your grandmother. if she’s the one who wants to adopt: she’s gonna have to explain that to you.  

your grandmother has to be willing to be a part of that. i think you should do it because i know that you have a lot of respect for her and you don’t intend to be cruel.  

i’m sorry you’re going through this: but as someone who was adopted: it’s a massive adjustment to go through: especially if you’ve been adopted in the past: especially if it’s a new family member.
she’s probably the most mature: happy adult i’ve met.

i’m sorry you’ve had to go through this. i’m sure she’d have
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you can still do it.
i’m not going to take her back. i’ve been on the waiting list for years to get her back. i’m also not going to take her back. she’s going to be angry: but i’m not going to take her back. i don’t want to be in a relationship where i have to deal with her.
i dont see it that way. 

i know that it makes me uncomfortable but i also don’t want to deal with it. the worst thing i can do is make it very clear that if she refuses to accept the decision i’ll have to end things. if she doesn’t understand that that: i’ll end it.
she has already decided to keep her head down and keep the relationship going. 

she needs to be more transparent with you. 


  [RESPONSE]your family may not know you: but you're too young to be in a relationship that doesn't work out. if they're willing to adopt you: they'll be able to deal with the issues that will make you feel abandoned.

you can't force your family to adopt you. 

you're younger than them and they are able to do whatever they feel the need to do. 

you can't force them to adopt you.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you should not. i am so sorry you are going through this. i have no idea how she will react.
first of all i want to say that you are going to be in a really difficult position. i have been in the same position. as i mentioned it is a very difficult situation. you have to decide if you are willing to put up with the constant abuse and neglect: or if you are willing to give him up for adoption. i cannot stress this enough. you will be in a very tough situation. i have been in one: and i had a great time. i would recommend you to take a time to think this through. i would not expect you to be happy forever nor to not have a future with him. this is not a good situation for you.

i know it’s hard but it’s not worth it.
i do. i would tell her that i want to be an adult and
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i'd recommend you see a lawyer to get a lawyer to help with the adoption. i hope you can get it done quickly.
thank you for your reply. i’ll do it. thanks again!
thank you for your reply. i’ll do it that’s a good idea.
i’m not sure how to proceed. 

i think it would be best if you take her out of the picture: but i’m not sure how she would feel about that. 

i’m not asking her to give up her right to her grandchild. but if she wants to help and wants to stay in the family: i’d have to have a talk about that.
thank you for your reply. i will definitely do this and i’ll give an update if anything comes of it.
thank you for your reply. i’ll definitely do that
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i know i'm not going to get her back: but it's okay if you don't. she is a part of my life. 

i hope you can’t give in and i hope you can do the right thing: just be grateful that you can’t.

good luck.
i’m here for adoption.

you can’t do anything about it.
you have to be able to give your grandmother up for adoption: even if it’s in the country: and in the end it’s your decision.

you have to be able to live with them: accept their wishes and let them make a choice for themselves.

you can also support family if they’re able.
thank you. i’m so sorry you are going through this. i really hope you can find a good family that will accept your decision and help you with
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]have you considered contacting the adoption agency and asking them to consider adopting you?
i would definitely consider it. i had a great grandmother and she was at the same time very sweet and loving. i wish i had been adopted as well. my only regret is being a virgin. maybe i would be able to help my grandma better understand the need for adoption. my mom is very proud of me and i wish i did something to make her proud of me as well. i know my grandmother will always be a part of my life and i don't want to let her down.
i’m so sorry you’re going through this! i can’t imagine the pain you’re going through. i’m so sorry for your loss. it’s so hard to understand the situation you are in. i’m so sorry. i hope you can find some comfort in the fact that your grandmother’s
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i can't afford to take the kid.  i know it's not easy.  but it's better than having to be a single mom.  i know my child will have to go to school under my roof.  i know that the school will need to offer it's services.  i know that i can't afford to pay for it.  but i can't afford to go to the funeral.  i know that i have to have the child be in the hospital.  i know that i can't afford to drive her to the hospital.  i know that i can't afford to take her to her school.  i know that i can't afford to pay for her to go to school.  i think that i can't afford to pay for her to go to school.  i don't know how much she will need to spend on her school.  i don't know how much she will need to spend on her
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i have a friend who has a cousin that has a boyfriend that is very much into his gf. it’s very scary but i know he doesn’t want to ruin the friendship.

i understand that it’s not your grandparents. it’s not fair to them. but i also know that it’s not fair to either of you. i’m not sure if i should do anything.

thank you for your advice: i’m going to try to do something about it but i’m not sure how to go about it.
i don't understand that. i don't know what to do. i feel like i can’t trust her to take care of me. she seems so nice but i feel like i can’t trust her to keep the relationship going.
i mean you can't really go anywhere.

you don't have to
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i don’t think it’s a good idea. i wouldn’t want my grandparents to be a burden to me: and it’s not fair to them. i don’t think it’s fair to them: and it’s not fair to me. i’m not saying i won’t adopt their grandchildren: but it won’t be fair to them either. i love my grandmother but it’s hard for me to accept that my grandmother will be gone if i do. i really want to adopt her but i don’t want to let her go.
i’m so sorry you’re going through this. you are entitled to your own decision. if you feel bad about it: just ask her to step up to the plate and adopt you. if she doesn’t: then you will have to leave. if she refuses:
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]this is so bad: please don’t.

if you have a good grandmother: you can’t say no: you have to be willing to take the risk and give up a part of your life.

i would make a plan. 

1. tell her you have an ex-gf so you can tell her you are not interested in having grandchildren. 

2. ask her if she would like to see your family if you have no grandchildren. 

3. let her decide what to do. 

you are going to have to decide if the kids will be adopted (or not) at any point.

i was adopted as a baby: and i've decided i don't want to have grandchildren at this point. it's been 10 years: and i don't really feel like i want to be with them. i will make the decision based on what she wants.
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i think you need to have an honest conversation with her about what she wants. you can't force her to adopt: you can't force her to adopt: you can't force her to adopt: you can't force her to adopt: you can't force her to adopt. you just have to communicate that you think it's important for her to have as much say in your decision as you think it's important for her to have in yours. 

you can't force him to adopt but you can suggest to him that it's okay if he wants to adopt. i think if he just doesn't want to adopt: you can't force him to. 

and if he wants to adopt then you can suggest to him to adopt. i think this would be a good idea: in the event that he wants to adopt: you can tell him to adopt you two. 

if he wants to adopt then you can suggest to him
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i'm in the middle of it. but i don't want to do it now: i think it's important for her to know.
thanks for comment.
this is not a normal situation. there are a lot of reasons why people are not willing to adopt. the first is the economic ones: the second is the mental health one. the third is the emotional one: the fourth is the financial one: and the fifth is the cultural one. 

the last one is the social one. since you are from a country with a lot of people in adoption: you might have a lot of social stigma around it.

the best way to deal with it is to not adopt the first place and to get through with the second place. the second place is the one you are adopted to. the third place is the one you are adopted to. the third place is the one you are adopted to. the fourth place is the one you
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don't know if i can.  [RESPONSE]you can’t force her to accept you. i’m sorry that you are going through this. you’re allowed to make your own decisions. don’t be a bigoted asshole about it. i’m sorry that you’re dealing with this. i’m sorry that you’re going through this.
op: i'm so sorry you are having to deal with this. it just sounds like you are struggling with feelings of guilt and shame. you need to sit down and think about why you are feeling this way. if you don't: it won't ever work. there is no need to guilt anyone. you can choose to stay with your grandmother and never adopt her.
is this what you want to do to her?
i think it’s ok for you to be open and honest about your feelings. i would just say you
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]if you or anyone you know is considering making this decision: please reach out to a national adoption center.

the adoption center will provide you with a special adoption certificate that will allow you to apply for a temporary adoption.

the adoption center will then process your application for a temporary adoption.

if you have questions: please contact the adoption center.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i’m a woman and my husband has told me he’d prefer to have me as a woman. i’m not going to be alone with my grandma.
so i’m worried that it’s not even an adoption: but a marriage?
is there anyone who can help you with this? i have a feeling it’s going to be a tough situation. i don’t know if it’s legally possible to have your grandparents adopt you: but i’m worried that it will be emotionally unwise. 
i think you should consider it a marriage and not a kid adoption. your grandparents are going to be happy to support you: but they’re going to feel a bit weird that you are being adopted and they’re going to have to be okay with that. 

i think i’m going to have to let it go if i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i had a friend who was so upset and upset by the adoption that she asked her sister if she could adopt her son because she felt like she didn’t want to be with her son anymore. she gave her consent to adopt the son and she felt so bad that her son didn’t get adopted. i thought it was so wrong but she had another baby for a while: and i thought i would be able to help her with that. 

my mother had a miscarriage when i was 10. it was so hard for me: even though i loved my dad: but i couldn’t do anything about it. i always had a huge grudge and i was so hurt to see my mother raise her son that i felt like i had to do something about it. i just felt like i had to do something about it because i didn’t want to be a part of the son’s funeral. so i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i am not going to: but i will. thanks.
hmm: i don’t think i’m going to take her back. i don’t think i can keep doing this. i just feel like i’m being a bad grandfather. i’m so sorry for your loss. i’m not sure if that’s the right time for it. i thought it’d be different if my father had decided to adopt.
i think you’re right: i’m not sure about her. i’m trying to keep it as family. i’ve lost so much of my family in the past few years (i’m 20)
i’ve been thinking about it for a while now. i’m not sure if she is a good person and i’m not going to get that chance. thanks for the advice
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. my grandmother is in her 70s and wants me to take her as a gift. i don’t want to lose my grandmother.  [RESPONSE]i don't think that your grandmother would really mind. she has been a wonderful person for her entire life.
i know it's easy to say “take her back” but it's really not. as the older sister of a couple of the people i have been around: i’d like to think of you as the little girl who should’ve been given a great grandmother.
as someone who has gone through this: i think it’s a shame that you’ve decided to keep her and give her up. 

also: you are wrong: it’s not selfish to feel that way. 

i have a sister who was the same way. she was a beautiful person and a wonderful grandmother. i loved her with all my heart. i
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you might be able to change someone's mind on the spot.
you can't. only you can.
i would have told her: but i have a feeling she would have blamed me for the adoption. i think i might have been too naive and naive to tell her.
i'm the same
you can't change them: you can only tell them to have a talk with the person they're going to adopt.
i wouldn't try to change them: you could only be that person. they might not want to change: but don't do anything to hurt them.

it's only a matter of time before they're taken from you and they're going to kill you.
i have a deep feeling that they may still not be willing to adopt.
i would let them decide if they want to keep you around as a friend or not. i would ask if they want you to help them with their adoption.
they
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. what should i do?  [RESPONSE]you are going to have to ask her.
you are going to have to ask her. 

when you first propose to her: don't ask her to go with you. 

when you propose to her: don't ask her to go with you.

ask her to go with you. 

don't ask her to go with you.

it's not a gift that she can choose to keep.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]i am so sorry this is happening to you. it really sucks for you but it seems like your grandma is a good person. 

i have a family member who has been in that same situation. they did what i would have done to my grandmother (i had the opportunity to adopt too): in the end it was a good decision. the only thing i can say is that you have to take care of your grandmother and if she is not able to take care of her own children: they are not going to be able to be.
i can't tell you what to do: but if you don't want to keep her: then i recommend you to give up on her. she is going to be a great grandmother: but i don't think her needs to be in the picture.
i wouldn’t tell her: that’s like a bad thing. she can say that if she wants to adopt: she can adopt
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]no! it won’t change anything.  you need to have a conversation with her.  tell her you’re concerned about her and have a talk with her about it.  if she refuses or tries to ignore you then you have to tell her.  i’m not talking about the adoption part of it.  but if she persists then you have to tell her.  if she doesn’t then you have to have a conversation with her.  if she doesn’t then you have to tell her.  her response will be to cut you off from her for life.  if she doesn’t tell you then you have to cut her off from you.

i’m assuming you’re in your 30s.  

if you don’t want to be with her then tell her.  if she doesn’t then you have to go find
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]you are not her son. she is your friend. she should not be asking you to do anything with her. she is not your sister or daughter. that is a deal breaker.

your relationship with her should be more like a family member. i would not let her take your grandfather away from you. you can make a decision to stay with her: but she should not take it away from you. also: please: please: do not go through with this.

i am not saying you shouldn't raise her. i am saying you should not try to raise her. you should not make her do it without you.

she should be able to say no. she should not be asking you to do anything. she should not be asking you to do anything.

i would take care of her and raise her as a child. i would not even allow her to own her own home. i would not let her have to
<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption.  [RESPONSE]it's not like you have to tell her. you can just let her know about the adoption.
i can’t help but feel like you’re trying to be a good friend.  and then you will be the one to take care of her!  

if you would have told her before about her adoption you wouldn’t have to go through this again. and if you still want to tell her about it you should also tell her the truth. 

my grandmother was a single mom for 25 years. when she adopted my grandfather she thought she was getting rid of the bad person. she felt guilty. she felt bad. and she was wrong. 

i know she was a good friend: but i don’t think we would have been able to handle that.
i don't think you should tell her. you can explain it in a way that doesn't hurt her feelings.

<|startoftext|>[WP] I want to give my grandmother up for adoption. i don't know what to do  [RESPONSE]you don't have to change your mind. she can still call you and ask for the adoption. 

the point of your post was to have an open conversation with her that doesn't sound negative. 

i think you should talk to her about this as well. 

i think you have to be able to see her as a person and not as a piece of meat. if you can't see her in a way that will help you in the future: then i think you need to move on.

i’m sorry that your grandmother has to go through this. 

i think you should try couples counseling. 

and yes: i’d be open with her as well: for the sake of the adoption process.

i don’t know if you could do that? it’s a different way of letting her know she�
