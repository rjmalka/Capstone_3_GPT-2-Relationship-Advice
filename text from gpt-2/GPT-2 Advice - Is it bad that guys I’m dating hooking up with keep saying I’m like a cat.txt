<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you’re right! i’s scared to even say it because i don’t want to hurt him. i’m scared he’ll say i’m not like a cat and then he will hate me. i’m scared if i say anything i’ll hurt him
i don't think it’s a big deal. it’s the fact that it’s coming from someone who is just having a bad day.
i think this is a trap. if you’ve never said anything to him: it’s going to be hard for you to tell him that. 

you can just say “hey: i’d like to propose to you. we can talk about dates and stuff. maybe we can get on a date or something.”

he’s going to say “hey: i’m
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m assuming you’re both young: and not in a relationship.
i guess it’s good to know your self and you’re not a burden to someone else.
it might be a good thing for your mental health if you get your head on straight. 

you’ve said it yourself that you’ve never been a “cat”. 

you’re definitely not a cat. if you’re a cat: it’s a natural thing to like cats.
you are an animal that needs to be petted: cuddled: fed: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted: petted
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you can’t control what men say. if he’s saying that to you: he’s not interested in you. 

however: you have the right to be upset. if he’s not interested in you: he’s not interested in you. you’re being cheated on. 

if he’s not interested in you: he’s not interested in you. 

if he’s not interested in you: he’s not interested in you. 

you’re being cheated on. 

when you are with him: you have to accept that you’re going to be fucked up by his behavior. 

it’s not right to have to deal with it. 

i’m not trying to be a dick here. you have every right to be upset about it.
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think it’s very different from the dating world. i’ve dated a guy who was super cocky: and when i was dating him: i told him i was a cat because he just kept saying that. he said it all sounded like cat noises: but i didn’t understand at first. i’m now the cat person and i know that he’s not that cat. i’m not saying i’m a cat: but i know he isn’t. i’ve also dated a guy who said i was a cat a lot more. i’m just saying that’s just how it is
i've been in your shoes. my partner has been so cocky before. i think it's completely different. i don't like how he's going to talk to me about stuff. especially about my body. i want to break up with him but i

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you are not attracted to that person. you are attracted to her. you can’t change her. you are not attracted to her for the same reason you can’t change yourself. she is not attracted to you. you’re attracted to her because you aren’t attracted to her for the same reason you are attracted to her. 

a couple things that will help you not to be in a relationship with her. 

1. don’t give in to the guy’s attempts to get you to fall for her. 

2. if she continues to talk about how you are attracted to her: make it clear that you don’t get this from her. you don’t get to manipulate you into thinking you’re in love with her.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don't think this one at all. they are just being coy and not saying anything and i think it's fine to be curious about them
you don’t have to be a dick about it.   but there’s nothing wrong with it if you’re not a dick.    i didn’t know i was either until i dated a girl who was: i thought i was the cat and that’s when i realized that’s why i’m so curious about the cat.   i’m not trying to get a boner in my face.   you are just curious about something that is important to you.   the cat is just a cat.  you are not a cat.  

people are so afraid of being ‘dumb’ so much in our day and age that they try to hide their feelings from us. 
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]it’s not bad. it’s not unhealthy. it’s just a really dumb thing to say. i think it’s a little rude of him to say that: but i don’t think he’s wrong to say it. he’s just saying that you’re just too sensitive. 

you can’t control your emotions. people can’t control their relationships. he shouldn’t be dating you. and you need to let him go. he has his own life and he can’t control you either.
i think you need to be honest with yourself and tell him (or anyone else) that you don’t want to be with someone who keeps saying things like that.
he is a creep because i’m thinking it’s a gross thing to say to someone who is having a conversation with you. i�
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think that you should be wary of this person. he may be trying to get you to do something to him: and that’s good because it means he is willing to compromise and to help you. i’m not saying he is not interested in you: but he might just be a good buddy. i’d also be wary of the guy who says he’s more like a cat and is willing to compromise and to help you. he’s not a good friend.
i don’t know anything about how to ask for him to be friends or anything: but it’s a deal breaker for me.
you can't expect to be friends with a guy who can't even read you. that’s just unacceptable.
hmm: it’s a good thing that you have a partner.  i’m going to have to agree with you: it’
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]yeah: i’ll be honest: i’m not. but it’s something that i’m thinking about. thank you for the advice!
i’m not sure that’s what you’re talking about.
yeah: i’m just going to have to ask that. i’ve been trying to ask her about it: but i’m not sure if i’m even doing that right now. it’s just something i want to ask her about.
i’m trying to bring it up with her: but it’s just something that i’m thinking about. thank you for the advice!

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]it’s not weird like that. i’ve been with guys that said that to me: like when i wasn’t sleeping and they were doing something: like a dinner: they would get upset and say that i’m not good enough for them because i’m not making enough effort to get over me. 

you can't tell what they’ve done to you. don’t get upset with them. if you feel like you need to: then try to talk to a guy about it. if you want to be more confrontational: then be more direct.
i guess you’re just not interested in them: right? you could try to talk about it with them about it.

i’ve known guys that have told me they’ve been in relationships with women that have been very attractive women. they’ve always said it’s not
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i didn't see it that way. i think it's normal. i'm not trying to be mean: i just want to be nice and try to keep things casual.
[deleted]
it's not bad at all. i'm not trying to be mean either. i think you should just be friends and maybe that will change for you.
i don't think it's bad at all. i think you should just be friends and think about it on a more realistic level: so that if you do decide to go on a date with him: you can be respectful and just say you'd like to have a few drinks: and then just go on a date. that's it.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you're not dating/hooking up with him. you're dating/hooking up with his crush as a way to get out of that situation. it's a waste of time: and she's not interested in him. he can't stop saying you're his cat. you can't stop saying you're his cat. you can't stop saying he's not the cat.

she's not interested in you. you'll never be able to stop saying that. so you have to leave.

this is just a suggestion.

if you want to stay with him: you would need to work with him to make him happy.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think you’re right: i’ve never been so sure. i’ve just never felt like i’m being used. i’ve only had one guy use me and never been able to move on. i’m just trying to make him realize that i’m not the one he wants to be with. he’s just being very blunt with how his behaviour makes me feel. i’ve been with him for 2 years and i’ve never been in a relationship where i felt like i’m being used. i’ve never felt like i was ever treated like a joke. i have never had a guy use me and not make me feel a joke. i’ve never felt like i’ve ever been treated like a joke. i’ve tried to bring it up before but i don’t feel like he’s listened
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m not judging at all. i’m just saying it’s okay to not get over your insecurities.
i didn’t talk to him about it. i thought he was being honest and that we should be able to work it out. he said he was just going to see what happens and if it’s going to be a problem then i’ll just end it. i’m not sure if it’s a good idea to continue to date him or not. i think i should end it and move on.
no he’s not.
this is what i was saying. i’m not judging. i’m just saying you shouldn’t be dating this guy.
yeah but they don’t talk about it at all.
you have to be able to talk about your insecurities to him. you can’
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE][deleted]
&gt;i’m not sure if he’s trying to cheat or just has a hard time dealing with his feelings and i’m not sure if he’s trying to talk to me about it.

i don't see how this would be an inappropriate comment.

maybe he thinks he's going to get a girl and you'll be his wife.

if the problem is with him: you need to let him go. 

if you can't deal with it and he's still telling you to stay with him: that's a problem if you're going to stay with him.

the issue is that you're going to have to learn how to interact with him in some way. 

if you want to have a healthy relationship with him and you want to learn to deal with that: you need to teach him about the relationship. 

if you
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you are not the cat and he is not the cat.

you are a person.

you are the cat.

you need to learn to recognize it and leave.

it is not your place to tell people what to do.

you need to leave him: and then get out of there.

you have to find a girl who will not be a friend.

don’t waste your time with someone who will not help you.
i’m not sure if you’re saying “i have no friends or family: i’m just trying to find someone who will support me” i am saying that if you’re going to be dating someone who is going to be putting you down: you should go for it and end it.
you need to leave. you deserve someone who will support you and give you everything.
you are a cat and he
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i'm not sure if you're asking a question or are just being straight up honest with your partner. 

if you're not: then i don't think you're a good person. 

you're asking for help. 

there are a lot of guys who don't want to put in the work to be a good guy. 

the answer is yes. 

the question is: do you want to be with someone who doesn't care about you? 

if that's the answer: then i'm sure you're going to do something about it. 

i'm not trying to be mean: but if you can't deal with it: then you won't be a good partner for me.
i think this is a good thing. there are so many guys that are the same as you. they will say it's a “no problem” in one way or another
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m not sure if you’re in the us but in an old post it said ""i’m going to go on a date"" i don’t think i’m dating him anymore. i would be happy to just cut it off.
i mean: that’s just how it was. i’m not sure if you’re in the u.s.
i’d say this isn’t about the guy and you’re in a relationship.  it’s about how you react to it.
i’m glad you're taking this relationship seriously!

it’s not a good relationship to start with. i wouldn’t be able to continue to hangout with him if it’s not based on the fact that you’re a woman.
i think it’s something that i do not
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]yes it’s: but he’s not a cat. he’s a human being. 

he’s not interested in you: he’s interested in him.

what you do is choose to be with him: and if you’re willing to be with him: you’ll make it work. there’s no guarantee that he doesn’t have some sort of mental problem that affects him. 

that’s the only thing that you need to worry about. if he has an issue that affects him: it’s likely a mental issue: or a personality issue: or something else. 

you’re not making this an argument. we are not arguing. 

it’s about communication. if he doesn’t want to talk to you about it: you have to be happy with the way you are
  [RESPONSE]yeah: i’m definitely in love with the guy and i’m happy to have the opportunity to hook up with him in the future.
he's clearly not interested: so there's a chance he's not happy with the relationship in the long run. 

you're right: if you ask me: even if you're not in love with him anymore: he's not worth it.
he's obviously not interested in you.  he's not interested in hooking up with you.
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don't know if you're in the us (although i've been): but there are websites and services that will help you decide if you want to be a good friend and partner. 

what i've found is that not everyone is interested in the same things. they just want to make you as a good friend and partner and not an object. 

there's also also this: if you're the type of guy who likes to be a good friend and partner: you'll appreciate the attention and interest from women. and you can see how they've been thinking: ""i want to get along with you and i want our relationship to be more than just friends. i want you to be a part of our life.""

i'll just recommend a couple of websites: just in case you're not in the us.

one of them has a guy that i'd say is a little bit of a jackass. he
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]that’s how i feel!
i don’t think it’s a big deal if it’s not a big deal to you either: it’s a big deal to the person you’re with. 

it’s like a bad smell: if it’s not there: you don’t want it in the bedroom.

i’m sorry for your loss: op.
if you need to explain:  i would try asking him to show you a picture of the cat.
i’m sorry for your loss: op. i’d think of the cat as a friend: not a pet.
you should be happy it's over. it's not fair for you to keep this relationship going with the cat. 

i think it's important that you get rid of your cat. it's not okay to keep a pet
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you don’t sound like a cat.   
i bet you’re just a really sweet guy who’s just trying to be cool.  
you are a guy who wants to be cool.  
i bet you’re a guy who wants to be cool.  
the more you talk about how cool you are: the more women you will have to work with.   
i bet you’ve talked about how you’ve talked about how cool you are and how cool women are.    
it sounds like you are really comfortable talking about women.   
the first step is to find women who you talk about with.   
the second step is to find women who are comfortable talking about women.   
the third step is to find women who are comfortable talking about women.   

the fourth
  [RESPONSE]i’m a woman and i’m really insecure about my looks. i’m not insecure about my looks at all and i think i’m just insecure about how people feel about my looks. i think a lot of my friends are insecure about their looks. just because we are not insecure doesn’t mean we are not cool. 

i’d say it’s good to be honest with someone about it. 

i think you’re not wrong for being insecure about your looks: but if you’re insecure: it’s time to go somewhere. 

in a relationship: you have to be open and honest about your looks and what your friends think. if you’re not open and honest with your friends: then it’s time to leave.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]this is a question. if you’re in a relationship you’re going to have to decide if you’re okay with the way his behavior is going to be with your girlfriend. if you’re not okay with it then you’re not compatible. if you are and you’re willing to work on it then you’ll have the chance to be compatible. if you don’t and you can’t work with him then i’d leave.
i’m glad you’re able to move past this. we all make mistakes. i’m not going to pretend to be perfect and you’ll never meet someone that you want to be with. if you can’t live with the behavior then you’re not compatible. it’s just a shame that you guys can’t change this part of you. 


<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think you should talk to her. what she does: what she says: and how you feel about it will most likely change her mind.

and i also think if you put in the effort to make it work you’ll be fine: but you’re going to need to tell her why you’re not willing to wait for her to move in with you.
i think you should definitely tell her to move out.

it's very common for a woman of high-functioning to get anxious and not speak to her in a relationship. 

however: i think it's very important to know that it doesn't mean she won't be able to maintain the relationship. 

i wouldn't be able to have a romantic relationship without knowing what's going on here.  

i'm in a non-monogamous relationship and i'm very familiar with the feeling of “

you don't have to worry about that.
i have to tell you this: you are a good girl. it's not your fault that he feels the same.

he is the one who needs to move out. he needs to be single for a while.
you're not a bad girl. i think you're right: i am not and i'm not expecting it to end anytime soon. i'm just trying to figure out how to move on to the next stage of my life and if that means being in a relationship or not.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat? [m22]  [RESPONSE]i don't think he actually is a cat so i don't know if his behavior is okay or not. i don't know if he's a good guy or is just being a creep. so i'm worried about him and i'm scared of him and i'm afraid of his reaction to me.

i'm also worried that he doesn't like me too much: so i'm worried that he might take advantage of me and use me as a way to get me to do something.

i don't want to be with someone who behaves this way.

i'm also worried because i'm afraid he might do things that i don't want to do.

i don't want to be with someone who has this attitude to me.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think it’s very bad behavior. if a guy feels that he’s being rejected: he’s a bad partner. it’s very easy for a guy to say that. i’d say he’s probably just trying to make you feel like you’re not special. maybe just keep it in the back of your mind that he’s trying to make you feel like you’re not special.
i don’t think it’s bad or anything. the problem is you can’t tell him what to do. 

however if he gets upset it’s okay to say something like that.
it’s not that bad at all. it’s that he’s so frustrated with the situation.

i’m sorry you’re going through this. i’ve had a guy who
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you can tell your boyfriend you are not interested in sex and he can reject you at any time.

if you don’t want to be friends with this person: you can’t be friends with him.

the problem is that you are still dealing with this and the more you go with the guy: the more he will say he is interested and the more you will go with him.

if you don’t want to deal with this and you are willing to be friends with the guy: then go ahead and be friends with him.

i mean: he’s not going to be happy to be friends with you.

is it really that bad?

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m not saying that’s wrong: but it’s possible that he doesn’t mean it that way. it’s really weird to talk about sex with another person in your life. and i’m not saying you should try to explain it. but i do think that’s something to think about.
maybe he’s insecure and wants to get off? idk: i’m just wondering if it’s something he’s trying to hide.
it's not a bad thing. i used to have sex with guys who would tell me they were attracted to me and wanted to have sex with me. they just didn't have the capacity for it/the ability to carry on with it. i knew the guys who did this: and i did what i had to do and got over it. i don't want to hear about it from friends: but it

[RESPONSE]i don't think it is: but it's okay. it is a dealbreaker for me. i'll let him know when he is feeling that way. sometimes he wants to be happy with himself but i want him to be happy with me. i can't force him to want me to come in the bedroom. but i can ask him to hang out with me. it's not like i'm going to be acting like a cat with a cat. if he says he wants to hang out with me that's cool. i can't force him to be happy with me. i can only ask him if he wants to hang out with me or not. i can't force him to want me. if he says no then he's not going to be happy with me. and i don't want to be with someone who doesn't want me.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]don't be so angry. if you don't get into a relationship with him he'll be an asshole. if you do it: you'll never get over him. it's a trap. he's trying to push you into a relationship you can't escape: but he won't put in the work to leave.
&gt;he is a weirdo and it’s not really a good thing to be with someone.

you are right: but he is also a weirdo: and he is not going to be able to control your actions or your thoughts. 

i would not give in to his attempts to control your thoughts. you are free to make your feelings known to him. you can say that you need to talk to him about this. 

however: i would ask him if you can have a talk about it. i would not be willing to be with someone who doesn't respect my feelings.

[RESPONSE]i’m a woman and i’m going to explain it to you. you are not a cat. if you want to make a move: you’ll have to do it. i’ve been in the situation where i got a guy to try to seduce me in the morning. i didn’t want him to try. i’m not crazy and i know it’s not right. i just got out of my relationship and did what i wanted. i was mad at him for not wanting to have sex with me and he made me feel like shit. i had to apologize for my behavior. i’ve told him i should’ve let him know that what he did was not okay. i don’t have a problem with the sex and i don’t want to be in a relationship where i’m a bad person. i also don’t want
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m not trying to be judgmental: i know that your relationship is great (and i’m not saying it’s great), but it’s not fair to say that you should just have no sex with him. there are so many better men out there: and he’s not one of them. 

i’m saying that you need to take a break from hooking up with him: and instead look at how you and your gf are handling this relationship. 

you’re young: and you’re still growing as a person. 

my advice is to not be in a relationship with someone who will continue to lie to you about it.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]it’s very bad.  he is not a cat and he is not acting like a cat.  he is a human being.  he needs to be treated for a mental health issue.  he needs to go back to his family home and take his medication.  he needs to go back to his therapist.  he needs to be evaluated by a psychiatrist.  he needs to see a psychiatrist.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his behavior.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his actions.  he needs to see a therapist about his thoughts.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his personality.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his actions.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his thoughts.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his thoughts.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his actions.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his thoughts.  he needs to see a psychiatrist about his thoughts
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]sounds like you've already got this.
i don’t think it is. not really. i think he’s just saying i’m crazy which i don’t think he really is. he just says i’m crazy. i’m just not crazy at all but i’m not sure if he meant it as a compliment.

i’m going to go with the first option because i’m not sure if this is a good one.
i think this is something you should talk to your boyfriend about. i mean: you don’t have to answer to him about it. but maybe you can talk about it with him and see if there’s anything wrong with it. if not: i’d just leave it alone.
you're right: i’ve been in a toxic relationship for a long time and it’s not
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]it’s not a bad thing. if he’s really a good guy he will understand that you are a human being that needs to be shared with others.

he may be immature but he’s entitled: you’re not.
it’s not a good thing. you both are human. he’s selfish. he’s a child.
if you don’t know him: you don’t know what he really thinks
he doesn’t know you
i’ve known guys who were very good at taking women back when they said they were no longer interested. that’s not what he thinks. he wants you to be his plaything. the fact that he is saying you are a cat is a sign that he doesn’t see you as a human being.

i know you have to have a conversation about it but he may
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]why the hell would you want a cat?
if you want a cat: then you should leave.  you sound like a bigoted asshole.  you need to grow up.  this is a big deal for a lot of us.  i would leave you and find a girl who has less of a sense of humor.
you could tell them to stop saying this shit.  you don't need to tell them to stop.  if you're feeling too insecure: that is fine.  they are your friends.  they are adults.  if you're feeling too insecure: that is fine.  if you're feeling too insecure: that is fine.  if you're feeling too insecure: that is fine.  they are adults.

i think it’s a bit of a weird thing to do but i’m not sure if you’re going to have to be friends with him any longer in the future. i’d just want to make sure he’s not saying anything more about you.
you’re young. you aren’t old.
you can’t. 

it’s not a good idea for you to do something like that.

i was in a relationship where i met my future husband: and we dated for a few months after we broke up. he was like: “shes a cat” or whatever: and i was like: “i don’t like cats.” and he said “yeah: but you’re not a cat.”

i was like: “but! you’re so cute!” and he said “yeah: i’m a cat.”

then i said: “so why “is it bad that i’m not like a cat?”

it's not that bad: but i think you should've spoken with your husband about it sooner.

it's not a good
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]that’s a big thing. i’m not really sure if it’s not a big deal that he’s saying that. i’m more concerned about the fact that i’m getting a lot of negative feedback from this girl. like i said: i’ve been in this relationship. i’m so worried that the stress i’ve been going through will make it impossible for us to continue our relationship.
i think you should tell the girl and see what her reaction is. if she says she doesn't want to hangout with you anymore: then just break up with her. or if she says she won't do that: then break up with her. 

you aren't going to win any friends if you keep trying to keep her around. especially if you keep bringing it up. 

i don't think you should push things out of her just because you

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don't think it’s bad to say that you’re really attracted to someone and it’s not like you’re using that to manipulate their feelings. your feelings are valid. 

i think you should be more comfortable with it. don’t be too hard on yourself. i am so sorry you’re going through that right now.
you have to be willing to break up with them. it also depends on the person. it has to be a guy: but also a woman.

the guy: i think: is an asshole. it’s not like he’s not capable of being someone who is respectful to the person he’s actually dating. he should be able to say he wants to be dating you. or it’s not a deal breaker.

the woman: well: he should be able to say that. he should respect you
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]that’s great advice! i’ve been in a similar situation and my boyfriend is also very insecure. i’ve noticed that his relationship with his girl is more complicated than we’ve been giving it. and i’m not sure how to work with him about how i feel about it.
i’m worried too. maybe i’m just overthinking it. i’m wondering if it’s a mental illness or maybe i’m really insecure. it’s just not a good idea to ask him to explain it. he has to say something or do something.
i think it’s an issue with the way he’s talking to you. he could be making you nervous and that’s why you need to be a little more gentle with him. don’t ask him to explain why you feel uncomfortable. your relationship is important to him
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don't think so. i don't think he's the cat person. he's the guy who tells me i’m like a cat: and he’s the one who keeps saying i’m like a cat.
i think you need to talk to a therapist to help you communicate with your partner.
i would go with “what do i say and do”. this is the best way to start. 

what would you say to him?

i don't think it's a good thing. i don't think it's bad. but it's not necessarily an excuse either.
i’m not trying to hurt you: i’d just want to understand.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]yeah: it’s not. 

they don’t realize that you’re not interested in them: they just want the guy who’s interested in them. 

you’re right: it’s not about the guy. it’s about the girls. 

the problem is you don’t want to date them. 

you’re too young to be dating women. 

i’m sorry to tell you but it’s not the age thing. 

it’s the inability to see their worth and the insecurity that comes with the age gap. 

the worst part is that you have to date them and they have to reciprocate. 

you’re too young to be dating women. 

you’re just too young to be with a guy who’s

i think it’s pretty normal for guys to talk about things they like about you and you’ll probably never know if they are really talking about what they really want. 

you just have to be honest and tell him to chill out. if hes fine with it: then go ahead and hook up with him. i know it’s not going to be fun and i’m not going to put up with it either: but if he is fine with it then great. if not then i’m not sure what is the problem.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m not sure if you’re a man or woman: but you should be careful to not be putting in the same effort as men. if they are not interested in you: you should just end the relationship.
i've been with my girlfriend for 7 years: and it’s been almost a year and a half now. i’m not trying to give her any advice: i’m just saying that it’s an important thing for both of you to take a step back and let’s see if you can still move forward. she’s not going to give you a second chance: and you’re not going to get her back.

there's a difference between being a dick and being a dick.
you're not dating him: you're just hooking up with a girl.

it's a good thing we don't have to deal with this nonsense.
it’s not your problem to tell him you don’t want to date him. it’s his.
what does he mean?
if you're interested in him: then i think you should be.

i’m not saying that you shouldn’t want to work with him: but it’s not healthy for you to be in a relationship where that’s a norm.
i think it’s really important to try to understand that this is a very common thing that men have to have to deal with. the way you’ve phrased it is really disrespectful. it’s not okay to say it in front of another person. it’s especially bad to use it as an excuse for a guy to walk away.

[RESPONSE]i'm not sure if you’re a woman or a man but i think you should just be wary of these comments. i know it might be uncomfortable but it’s a sign of insecurity. especially in the beginning: and while you’re insecure about it - it’s important to look at the bigger picture.

i think you should be wary of them saying things like that at all. just don’t be too harsh on yourself or other girls. they’re insecure as well if they aren’t taking care about you. they don’t have to tell you. 

but you should also be wary of them saying things like that: because you might be the one that breaks up with them.

if you have an open relationship with someone: then i’d be very careful about saying that. i’d be looking for signs that you’re being manipulated by him. you’re not going to find that if you go by his actions and not his words.
this one is the most common response to being in a relationship and i’m guessing it’s to make you feel comfortable with him. it’s like he’s not comfortable with you being with him.

as for the man who said this: i’m not saying he’s a douchebag: but it’s very weird when he says this. 

if you’re comfortable with that: then it’s okay to try dating. if not: then it’s time to move on.
what if he wants to take you with him for a trip?

i don't really know the advice to offer: but i will say this. i have never met a man who doesn't want to take me on a trip. i would not want to be a part of a trip with him. i would not want to be a part of a trip with him. i would not want to be a part of a trip with him. i would not want to be a part of a trip with him. i would not want to be

if you’re willing to work on it: then yes i would. if he doesn’t: then i would not wait for you to feel comfortable enough to say anything.
i don’t know if you’re in any relationship or not. i would definitely let him know what’s up and ask if he needs an out if he needs to be able to vent. but i’m also in a relationship and i’ve never heard of a person being able to vent about what’s wrong with them in their relationship.
i had a friend who was in a relationship and he would make fun of me for going to my friends house and saying i’m too emotional and i need to be more assertive. i would tell him that if he keeps doing this i have to leave
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think you should just end it.
it’s not a good thing to be doing it.
you’re a girl: you’re not going to get over a guy who is not going to respect you.
i don’t know if i’m being overly negative here: but if you really want to try to work on things with him: ask him to change his behaviour. ask him to put in more effort to make you feel better.

it’s not that bad a thing to have to stop being a virgin when you’re not ready. it’s really not a big deal.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]you can tell her that and she will learn how to handle it.
i don't think you're a bad guy: but you've got to talk to her about it because it affects her confidence. maybe she's got a crush on someone she's really interested in and she's like “okay i guess i would’ve liked it if it was me” but she really isn't. maybe you just don't want to date her anymore and end the relationship. i'm not sure if that's a good relationship move from either of you and there's a chance she's got a history of it.
i wouldn’t worry about it. it’s normal to be shy around your friends and family in general. it’s not a big deal. just try to make friends: hangout together: and eventually be friends. it’s not rude to be shy around other people.

i don’t think it is. i don’t think it’s a joke. i’ve told him all about how i feel. i’m not interested in spending time with him.
i think you should be fine being friends. he won't care about who you hang out with. it was a joke and if you guys don't take that threat seriously: then you guys would have to work through it. 

it's not ""your problem"": it's his. he needs to know. if he doesn't: you should have a talk with him
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think it’s a bad combination of things. 

i think it’s a good thing to ask because it will show you if you’re not being accepted and if you’ve not taken it in stride
i think it’s fine to say “hey: it’s okay if you want to hangout with me: i’m just looking for time to meet up with someone else and not being interested in my life anymore”. 

if you don’t know if that’s okay then i would break up with you. 

i’m not sure if you’ve said this to anyone else: but i’m worried that if you do then he’ll just be like “hey: you’ve been messaging me for a long time” and then say “hey: i’m
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don’t think that’s the case. i’m not sure if it’s because they’re insecure: but they should be honest with their partner.
i'm not saying it's bad: but they should be upfront with their partner. they have the power to reject you and if they don't know then it's time for you to move on with your life.
i'm in a relationship and i'm not going to tell my partner about this. i'm just not sure how to make them feel comfortable with it.
so if you want to keep dating them: tell them you're not interested in the relationship: then move on. i think you should have a real conversation about it: and if they don't: have a real conversation about it. they should know what you've been up to and how you've been. if they don't: they shouldn't waste any more time on a
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i'm a guy who's been in this situation and it makes me feel that way. i'm not trying to be mean or make me feel bad: i just don't want to be treated like a cat. i feel like i'm not being treated in any way like that. i've had conversations about it: but it just gets ignored. i have a guy who i started dating: who i've been trying to get back with for a couple months now: but he keeps bringing up that i’m a cat and i don’t want to be treated like one. i don’t know if i can get past this: i just don’t want to be treated like a cat: i just don’t want to be treated like a cat. i just want to be treated like a cat.

i’m not saying i don’t want to be treated like a cat: but i

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think it’s good that you’ve been asking her out. she may not like it: but it’s worth asking her to come over and see. i’m not saying she should go out of her way to ask: just that it’s probably a bad idea to hookup with someone who is not interested in you. i’m not sure if it’s a good idea to hookup with someone who is interested in you: but if it is: then it’s a good thing you talked with her about it because it could potentially be a red flag for someone else.
as a guy i’m not sure how to respond to someone saying you’re like a cat.

i think you guys should just talk about the situation with each other. then decide if it’s a dealbreaker for you. if not: then you can separate.

<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think the main thing is to think about the other person as a person first. i think that’s what’s really important with this guy. i’ve always thought it’s bad when guys go into a “let’s all get together” sort of mentality. i’m not saying i shouldn’t have a conversation with him: but i think it’s something we should certainly discuss. maybe if you’re uncomfortable that’s ok: but if you don’t then i don’t think it’s a good idea to invite him to.
it’s just a question. 

do you guys think it’s a bad thing to use phrases like that to make people feel uncomfortable?
it sounds like you are uncomfortable with the situation and you need to decide if it’s a dealbreaker for you.
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat? what advice would you give them?  [RESPONSE]what's the issue with hooking up with a cat? we were talking about that. 

i'm very confused.
there's always the possibility that they're not interested in you. they might be trying to get you to have sex with them. or they aren't interested in you at all. 

that's what i'm trying to figure out. i don't understand why it's a dealbreaker for them.
if you’re dating someone: you’re probably going to have to try to get over it. if it’s an issue for you: i’d say you should just cut it off.
i’ve never had a guy saying this to me. it’s the worst. i’m just going to go ahead and say that.
it’s not a problem to be honest. you’re going
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]it’s not normal either.

if you are attracted to someone else: it’s ok to be friends with them. i’m trying to get over my attraction and have fun with people. it’s not like i’m the cat.

i’ve had a similar experience with my so. he never talked about it with me. it’s been over 3 years now and i’m still in love with him. i’ve found that i’m able to talk about this with him about my feelings (which he never does) because i do not want to make it about me. i also realize that my feelings are not valid.

i think if you are not comfortable with the idea of dating: i’d just cut it off. if he wants to stay with you: he will.

i’m the cat. i�
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i would say they don't. they are saying they have to be nice to you. that means you have to be nice. they can't be nice for you. they can't be nice for others.

it's really not a big deal. they are making you feel bad and they are telling you they don't want to hurt you. but they don't. what they do is hurt you. they are hurting you.

the fact that you're still with them doesn't make it ok.

your friend is not your friend. he is a predator and you can't let him go.
as someone who has been in a relationship and cheated: i understand the feelings you have about the whole situation. it sounds like you’re not feeling comfortable with the way they are treating you: and it’s time to let them go.
they’re not going to stop. they’re just going
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don’t think it’s a good thing. 

if he’s not interested: it’s okay if you cut contact. 

you don’t have to worry about it.
i think this is a huge red flag.
i think it’s a good thing he is dating you. if he wants it to work: you should just end it.
thank you: i’m not in the mood to hangout.
i think it’s very concerning. i’m sorry you were in that situation. i’m sorry you lost your boyfriend. it’s your life.
yeah: i agree with your comment but i think he’s probably not interested in you. it’s not like he’s not interested in you.
you’re going to need to go out and find someone who will
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i’m not saying you need to dump him. but i’m saying you need some space from the man for a while: and i’m not saying you can’t break up with him. if you’re both happy in your relationship then that’s the way it is. i’m saying you guys should communicate what you want and then maybe you can come to a compromise where you both want a compromise.
my husband and i don’t have sex anymore: but sometimes i’m up and leave. i don’t want to hurt him or be a drama queen. he doesn’t want to be with me. i don’t want to hurt him. i’m just not ready to be with him. i don’t want to hurt him. you can leave him: you’re not married to him. if he wants to
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i know the answer is no: but i know this is a big thing to talk about with someone. 

i know what men mean when they say “just look sexy”: but they have to be real with you. 

if you really have to: you can say something like “i really like you and i want to see you at a party in a few days: but i think you are too shy to come with me?” 

i have seen guys say things like “i’m going to party with you because i’m hot right now”

i’m not saying you have to be shy: but if you are going to be honest with someone: you have to be confident and talk about your feelings with them. 

you can also say it in a way that’s: “i just want to see you at a party
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i never said it was bad. it was just a weird thing to say.

i feel like there's a lot of misunderstanding and i don't want to lose my relationship with her. maybe she's just insecure.
no: i didn't say that. i said that you should be careful and respectful when you say it. i would also be careful and respectful when you say ""hey: i'm a cat: i'm a cat""
i’m not saying you should be with her. i’m saying you should be careful.
that's not what i said. i'm saying that it's weird to say that. it's also weird to say it in a relationship. i mean: there are so many people saying that. and if you say that in a relationship: it's a huge deal.
i don't understand why it has to be so important: but you can't be with someone who doesn't
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i can tell you two: if you do it that way: then it’s going to be a problem for the rest of your relationship.
it’s okay to be angry. i’m not saying you should stop talking to them. but it’s not okay to be making it so much about how bad it is. if it bothers you: you can always end the relationship. if it bothers you: you can move on. but i don’t want to be angry about it.
i think it’s more of a feeling that’s making it more painful to deal with. i think that you guys both need to sit down and talk about what’s bothering you. that’s how you can really fix it.
i'm a guy who had the same problem. after a year: i couldn't handle it. it was about 1 month before i met my wife and
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]no. it’s not bad. but it’s not healthy either. i’d say the relationship is at a serious point: you can’t do anything about it. but you can have a conversation with him about it. and also: you should think about what it has to do with the other girls.
i think you should at least ask him if he really feels like that. if he doesn't: it's not a good relationship and it's not healthy either. this is a problem with his attitude and his language.
i think you should ask him if he really feels like that. if he doesn't: it's not a good relationship and it's not healthy either. i'm not saying any of that: i'm just saying that if you are not comfortable with it: it's not healthy to continue to be in a relationship with him.
you should talk about boundaries and make it clear you want
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i don’t think it’s bad at all.  i’ve personally never had a guy say that.  i’ve never been in a situation like that.  i’ve had guys say it was disrespectful and i shouldn’t date someone like that.
what’s the problem with saying “hey: i’m not like a cat: i’m a dog.”   if you want to date someone: you have to be very upfront about it.  or: you can end the relationship.   i’d say the second you’ve done that: it’s time for a fresh start.
i think you could have just said “hey: i don’t like playing games: i’m not going to be around when you do.”

if he’s playing games: he
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]the fact that he's trying to be a good guy is very concerning. i think you should approach him and tell him how you feel. if he's really upset about it: he'll just say he wants you to stop/stop seeing him because you're dating his ex and he's going to break up with you.
i can understand that: but i do not think the relationship is healthy. he says he doesn’t want to get with you anymore. i don’t think that would be fair or healthy to him/you. it’s not like you’re getting dumped. he’s telling you to stop seeing him.
this is the same problem that i had with my ex. i was pretty much the same way. she had the same kind of attitude and i had the same kind of attitude. she was a very nice person and we went to a party and i sat down and talked to her
  [RESPONSE]if you’re not interested in him and you don’t want to date him: then don’t meet up with him. don’t waste your time with someone who is not interested in you.
  [RESPONSE]i think you’re right. i’m not very good at it but if he has a bad habit of saying that to me i’ll be worried. i’m just worried because i don’t know if he’s trying to get back with someone else or not.
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]that's a very strange thing to say. i'm not going to tell you that you're going to fuck up your relationship by sleeping with some guy you know nothing about: but maybe you should talk to him about it: as it's not a good sign that he's going to take you seriously.

if you're willing to let him have his cake and eat it too: then sure. i would let him have his cake and eat it too.

at the end of the day: you're going to have to decide what you want and if he's willing to take you seriously. i don't think you should make a decision based on the way he thinks about your relationship at all. it sounds like you're comfortable with the way things are: but i'm not going to tell you to stick around with that.

it's not a good sign: but at the end of the day: there's not much of a difference
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i'm not sure if you're in a relationship or if this is a common problem. i think it's good to be aware of your partner's behaviour and try to explain this to him. like you said: you aren't worried about the guy's reaction to it or your feelings. but it's better to let him know that you're concerned that he might react negatively to it.

i think it's important to have a conversation with him if you have concerns because you don't want to risk him not wanting to hang out with you any longer.

i would say that if you can ask him about the issue: you might be able to set some boundaries with him where you don't have to talk about it.

it doesn't sound like he has any intention of actually seeing you: as you have mentioned that you're in a relationship. he might just be scared of that conversation: which is understandable. but if he does:
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]it’s a lot easier to say “you’re like a cat” than to try and argue with him.

i’d say that a guy who thinks that you’re too sweet and flakey has a lot of issues.

i’d say that this guy has a lot of issues: but he’s trying to control you and you need to get with him if you want to be with him.
i’m not saying he should be in a relationship with you. it’s just an idea to try something. but he needs to learn how to be a real man to be in a relationship with you.
i’m with you.  i am just a guy.

i’ve never dated a girl who was like this. if i were you i’d throw a fit. if he wants to try something i�
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]your answer is no.

if you love someone: you shouldn't be saying that stuff.

you shouldn't be asking them for sex.

your girlfriend probably doesn't want to do it or she's afraid of offending you.

your girlfriend probably didn't want to get on too high.
you’re too young to be feeling this way. and to be honest: you’re not even sure if you want to end things. do you want to be with someone who is going to be in the same boat?

if you are going to end things: then you have to talk to your girlfriend and have her explain to you that the situation has changed.

if you are going to end things: then you have to talk to your girlfriend and have her explain to you that the situation has changed.

if you are going to end things: then you have to talk to your girlfriend and have
  [RESPONSE]it’s not that bad. just because you’re not interested in the guy or the relationship doesn’t mean you’re not interested in them and not giving yourself the space to find out.
if you are dating someone that is actually into you and you want to hook up: then it's fine and healthy. 

if you don't: then just say no.
i think if you are into him: it’s okay to ask you. ask him: and if he is not into you: then that’s up to your next relationship. if he’s interested: then don’t be with him.
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]i think the problem here is that they're not telling you. if they were upfront: it would have been obvious and you would have known.

you can just say ‘hey: i don’t think you're interested in me. you should have told me sooner. i think it’s time to move on.’ and then move on to someone else.

maybe they're afraid to be upfront because of the backlash. if you were honest with them: they would have known.

i would say that you should have told them sooner.

you are in a relationship.  you should have been upfront and honest.  they should have told you sooner.
i think it’s a good thing. people are very afraid to tell you and not know if you’re interested in them.
it's not about ""having a good relationship"" it's about getting laid. if it's
  [RESPONSE]you're making it worse.

you can change. you can ask him to stop. you can try to leave and walk away. or you can take time to think about it: and then talk about it: and then decide if it's a dealbreaker.

if it's not a dealbreaker: then you can end it. if it is: then you can end it.

that's it. no reason to waste time on him.
<|startoftext|>[WP] Is it bad that guys I’m dating/hooking up with keep saying I’m like a cat?  [RESPONSE]yeah... i’m not going to lie. if you are into guys that are into you: you can’t leave them.

as for the guys that are not: you do have to be honest with them. if you’ve told them you’re not interested: they don’t have to deal with you.
i mean: people can be mean. if you feel the same way: it's probably not best to keep dating them. you don't have to be rude about it: but just be honest.

i agree with you: it's not rude to tell them you are not interested in them. it's just disrespectful.
